Having a strong database is important, but building one up isn’t something every agent takes the time to do. If you’ve been following my content for a while, you probably know that it took me eight or nine years to fully grasp this, myself. Now that I have, I’d like to share what I’ve learned since then with all of you.&nbsp;

One of the most crucial lessons to remember on this subject is that **it’s eight times easier to get leads from someone you already know than to get leads from a new business.** I first learned this from my friend Bill Pipes, a Tom Ferry real estate coach, and keeping this in mind has made an incredible impact on my career.

This isn’t to say that other prospecting methods aren’t effective; only that agents must never underestimate the importance of staying engaged with the people who you know and who have supported you. The people in your database don’t need to be convinced of your skills or experience. They already trust your abilities.

So, as you can imagine, these established relationships are a great doorway into new relationships. And, **as those new relationships are nurtured, your database (and the opportunities that come from it) will grow exponentially over time.**&nbsp;

On our team, we make it a priority to connect with our database between 50 and 70 times each year. Whether through phone calls, emails, text messages, or event invites, our team endeavors to let past and present clients know that we are always available as a resource to them.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information about nurturing your database, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
