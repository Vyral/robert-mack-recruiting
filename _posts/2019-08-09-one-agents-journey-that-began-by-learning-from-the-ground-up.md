If you’ve been tuning into my recent videos, you know that my mission is to offer guidance, mentoring, and tips and tricks to help you and others in the community become better agents. To that end, today I’ve brought on fellow agent Ryan \_\_\_\_ to talk about his experiences since joining my team and as someone who was in hospitality for over a decade, what it’s been like to reinvent himself professionally.

**Ryan was in the restaurant and bar business for just over 11 years before deciding he wanted to break into the real estate industry.** So, he completed his classes and earned his license to practice. As a new licensee, he wasn’t sure what his next step should be, but he knew he wanted to be part of a team.

He got in touch with a few different teams and brokerages, and in the process, he met me. Thanks to his previous experience, Ryan had developed strong interpersonal skills and had a knack for customer service, but he knew that above all finding a mentor would be his key to success in real estate.

**During our conversation, I assured Ryan that I would teach him the practices and systems that would mold him into a great agent over time**, but I also let him know in no uncertain terms he’d be required to learn from the ground up. This was refreshing to Ryan: He was skeptical of other brokerages he spoke with because they attempted to persuade him with unrealistic claims that he’d have instant success and wealth working for them.

Not long after, the two of us arranged another meeting and we discussed what it would take for Ryan to become a great agent—a decision Ryan says he’s glad he made. **Being part of our team has allowed him to grow his business far beyond what he believes he could have accomplished on his own.**

When I got into the business back in 2006, real estate teams were the exception, rather than the rule. In fact, I didn’t really know what a mentor was, and I didn’t have the money to hire a business coach. I was mostly left to fend for myself and learn through trial and error what worked and what didn’t. Though I had a solid family and friend base to help me get my start, my first six to eight years were a grind.

Over the years, as I’ve built my team and fine-tuned our systems and strategies, I’ve gained an abundance of experience helping buyers, sellers, and investors as well as an understanding of what it takes to become a great agent.

If you’re a newly licensed agent or you’re in the process of earning your license and you’re watching this, we can’t emphasize enough how tough this industry is. The failure rate is right around 90%, and if you don’t have a mentor looking out for you in the early stages of your career, your likelihood of success is significantly lower.

**As daunting as it may seem, becoming a great agent is possible and Ryan’s story is evidence of that.** Beyond leveraging his relationship-building skills, Ryan needed to learn the fundamentals of the business—how to show homes, write offers, help sellers, negotiate commissions, negotiate on behalf of his buyers, and the list goes on. All in all, Ryan’s decision to become part of our team couldn’t have worked out better for us or him, and we’re grateful he's with us.

In closing, if you’re currently or about to be an agent and you’re wondering what your next step should be, Ryan and I would love to have a conversation with you, so don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to answer any of your questions or set up a strategy call with you today\! Until then, happy selling\!
