<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I’m sharing how to grow your database and therefore expand your business.</em></p>

Are you speaking to new people every day? Today I want to discuss building your database. **It’s critical to have a database** and you should make sure to call and engage with the people in your database. Most of your business should be coming from your database. Your database should make up about 50% to 70% of your business. If it’s not, you may want to review your business and see what you’re doing each day.&nbsp;

How do we continue to grow our database? We’re receiving customer information from multiple different sources. You may be getting contacts from Zillow, Facebook, open house customer inquiries, and so on. You are continually being bombarded with contacts that you don’t know that might need help with real estate. What you need to be doing is take all this information and regularly add it to your database.&nbsp;

**On my team, we have different stages of clients:**

Stage one: &nbsp;Someone you’ve never met.

Stage two: &nbsp;Someone you’ve had a conversation with.&nbsp;

Stage three: You’ve met in person, they’re in your database, and they’re now going to be a client.

Expand your database by having new conversations with new people. The beauty of this world is that we’re extremely connected now. There’s social media that’s steadily becoming a colossal part of our lives, you’re in line at the grocery store, you’re playing football with friends, you’re going to church; you’re constantly doing things that allow you to meet new people. **When you’re in sales, you’re always “on.”**

The most crucial part of the message today is to make connections with new clients and maintain them\! The database is essential to any agent’s business. If you’re not on the hunt for new conversations every single day, and you aren’t concentrating your efforts on your database every day, you’re going to have a rough time developing a sustainable business in real estate.&nbsp;

If you want to set up a strategy session to learn about the methods we use to build up our database please reach out to me. Those sessions are free because I enjoy speaking to other agents and learning more about them. If you have any video ideas you want me to talk about in the future, send those my way. If you have any questions about real estate, reach out to me by phone or email. I would be glad to speak with you.&nbsp;
