If you’re a newer agent or one who is building their business or a veteran agent who is looking to set yourself apart, you need to pay attention to follow-up. **Once you have a database, and as you learn how to add people to it, follow-up becomes extremely important.**

It’s not about just making one phone call and hoping for the best. It’s about nurturing a relationship over time, building trust, earning business, and closing the sale. **Here’s as short story from my experience that might put things into perspective.**

I was in the market to buy a new car, but I hadn’t bought one in a long time. I became a lead and I wanted a Toyota 4 Runner. **I sent an email out to 10 different dealerships asking them all the same questions.&nbsp;**

I got a lot of automated responses, I got a lot of people who followed up with one email, and other people had manual custom emails from the start. I went back and forth with a few different salesmen until I narrowed it down to three. **I based my decision on the quality of content they sent me, how authentic I felt their emails were, how much value they bought in those emails, and the quantity of their follow-up.** At the end, I had a phone conversation with all three finalists. It was a nice lesson for me as an agent. Sometimes you have to work an email until you can get in touch with a person.&nbsp;

After my phone conversations, I got their pricing, and ultimately one salesman stood out. I went in and was out within an hour and a half with my new car.

**You have to understand that buying a home is a huge decision for someone.** It’s a massive commitment and a lot of buyers are scared and nervous, but excited. That’s exactly how I felt when I got my new car. It’s important to keep those emotions in mind, because if you don’t have empathy, you will lose.&nbsp;

Above and beyond the empathy, you also have to understand that our leads are talking to more than one agent. **If you reach out once, you're wasting your time.** What should you do to follow up?

You could:

* Send mailers
* Door knock
* Invite them to an event
* Send texts
* Send videos
* Reach out through social media
* Call them
* Email them

**On our team, we average about nine touches per prospect until we get a contract signed.** They can include any and all of the above.&nbsp;

The moral of the story here is that if you’re getting leads and referrals, you can’t just call them once and expect them to buy in. You need to consistently follow up and offer value. **We don’t just check in—we contact our prospects and offer value at the same time.** It’s so important.

If you have any questions for me in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
