Whether you’re a brand-new agent or an experienced agent trying to build your database, you need to professionally network. How do you build a strong network? **The answer lies in having strategic referral partners.&nbsp;**

My strategic referral partner Ryan McMillan and I are both a part of BNI (Business Networking International). If you’re trying to get into a BNI group, you know the struggle is real. I had to start my own, while Ryan was able to be in the right place at the right time and cultivate some great relationships to get into his. In any case, belonging to BNI forces us to get to know other professionals in our area.&nbsp;

Ryan’s BNI group has around 15 or 16 members, while mine has about 30. Combined, that’s about 45 professionals we can educate about the real estate business and who we can refer our clients to. We love referrals because they show us that we’re doing great work and that our clients trust and value us.&nbsp;

**In terms of value, having a strategic referral partner is the gift that keeps on giving.** For example, let’s say you meet with an estate planning attorney. Their primary role is to help clients with their living trust, and people who get living trusts are the same types of clients Ryan and I like to work with. A strategic referral partner must share the same type of client you want, so if you can develop a relationship with an estate planning attorney and you each become a trusted resource for each other, they’ll continuously funnel their clients over to you.&nbsp;

As an agent, you know how hard it is to get referrals and “wow” your clients. Working hard and finding someone who can provide a steady stream of referrals is the key to staying ahead of the game.

Ryan tried for a couple of years to join BNI before finally getting in, and he recommends joining a professional networking group no matter what profession you’re in. If your business is real estate, though, it’s the best thing you can do. As he explains it, real estate is all about meeting people and building relationships, and he never would’ve met the 15 people he meets with every week if he never joined a professional networking group. It will only benefit your business, and you’ll develop great relationships you may benefit from down the road.&nbsp;

**Remember—there’s no wrong way to network.** If you love mountain biking, join a mountain biking club. If you love photography, join a photography club. The goal is to find yourself in situations where you’re talking to 10, 15, or even 30 people consistently. Everyone knows that people only do business with those they know, like, and trust.&nbsp;

The bottom line is, if you’re not seeking out strategic referral partners, you’re missing a big piece of the action.

If you’d like to talk more about how to network or the value of having a strategic referral partner, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. Until then, happy selling.
