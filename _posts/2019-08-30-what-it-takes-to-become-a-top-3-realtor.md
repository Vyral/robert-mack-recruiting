Today I have some real estate industry statistics to share with you so you can understand where you sit among your competition. I was at a Tom Ferry event last week where he discussed a surprising statistic for real estate agents both globally and in our local market.

Right now, there are 1.7 million Realtors in this country. Of them, only 43,000 were able to sell 25 homes or more. That’s just 2.5%.&nbsp;

**If you’re selling 25 homes or more on a yearly basis, you are in the top &nbsp;3% of Realtors nationwide so congratulations.**

However, the numbers shift a bit here in Orange County. There are over 16,000 agents here, but only 400 sold 10 or more homes. That’s also the top 2.5%.

**If you’re selling 10 or more homes per year here in Orange County, congratulations to you.** You’re in the top 3%, too.

The reason I’m sharing this with you is because the other 97% of agents are struggling. These agents need help, they’re winging it, and doing their best to keep their heads above water.

What can you do to position yourself to be in this top 3% if you aren’t? For starters, you need to start treating real estate like a business. **You need to be committed daily by generating leads, showing homes, and getting deals done.**

If you’re a solo agent and desire to build a business that’s thriving, you simply can't do it on your own. You need to align yourself with talented individuals that will take you and your business to another level.&nbsp;

**This is what we offer at The Robert Mack Group.** We have a strong structure, complete with systems, a great admin staff, and other full-time agents that you can align yourself with and learn from.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how our team operates or how you might be able to elevate your career by joining us, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
