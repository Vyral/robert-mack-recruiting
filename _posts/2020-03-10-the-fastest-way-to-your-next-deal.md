One of my mentors once told me that it’s several times easier and more cost-effective to go after referrals through people you know as opposed to those you don’t know. **Agents need to avoid the ‘shiny pennies’ of the real estate industry**—we can be distracted by websites that promise to send you leads if you spend lots of money on social media. You can certainly get leads that way, but those are low-quality leads because those people don’t have a relationship with you. Relationships are key to successfully closing a transaction.

**So how do you get ahead of the problem?**

Start talking to the people you already know and like, people who will stand behind you and refer business to you if you do good work. I don’t expect referrals from people if I’m not doing a good job, and you shouldn’t either. That’s why we’re always pushing to enhance our clients’ experiences—so they’ll &nbsp;recommend us to their friends and family.

Think about who you can call that you’re comfortable with. I’ve heard of so many agents’ family members selling properties without telling the agent because they think they’re too busy or they don’t want to bother them. Don’t assume that people are just going to come to you for their buying and selling needs just because you have a relationship with them. You need to nurture your friends and family just like you do your past and current clients. The rule is the same for them: out of sight, out of mind.

Some good examples of people to contact are **friends, family, past coworkers, and the members of any clubs or organizations you’re involved with** (both personal and professional). I’ve sold many properties simply because of my gym membership\!

There’s no wrong way to generate business, but if you’ve had a slow quarter and you’re looking for another transaction quickly, comb through your database for people who know, like and trust you and start sending them updates.

There’s an opportunity right now to take advantage of the market, whether you’re buying, selling, refinancing, or looking to invest, so get out there and spread the word. **Control the narrative by letting your people know that the train’s in the station and it’s about to leave.**

As you educate people, you add value to their lives, and they’ll start to see you as a professional resource, meaning they’ll send you business. Don’t be a secret agent.
