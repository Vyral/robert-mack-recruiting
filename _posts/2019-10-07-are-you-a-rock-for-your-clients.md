The real estate process can be quite overwhelming for buyers and sellers. Emotions run high, expenses can run deep, and energy can run low after days or weeks of striving toward the closing table. This is where you come in.&nbsp;

**As an agent, part of your job is to advocate for your clients.** When you work by a buyer or seller’s side, you’re not only bringing your knowledge, experience, and resources to the table but also a neutral perspective through which they can more clearly assess the deal at hand.&nbsp;

So if you inadvertently put off negative or nervous energy around your client, this can create an unfortunate domino effect. The slightest hint of unease on your end can easily snowball into an emotional meltdown for your clients, who will tend to use you as their “rock.”&nbsp;

Now, you may be thinking that all of this sounds well and good, but feel uncertain as to how you can actually put these concepts into practice. **How can you be a rock for your client?&nbsp;**

First, you need to have a mentor. Whether this mentor is a business coach, a colleague, or a broker, the most important thing is that this person is someone you can trust to be your rock. Your mentor should keep you steady so that you can do the same for your clients.&nbsp;

**But what if you don’t have a team, broker, or mentor you can turn to?** If this is the case, please reach out to my team and me. Our team has systems, structures, and training in place to help agents like you succeed at their full potential, and we’d be happy to have a conversation about whether joining us could be the right next move in your career.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
