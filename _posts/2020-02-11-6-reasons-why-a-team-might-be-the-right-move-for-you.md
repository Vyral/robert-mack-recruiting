<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are six key reasons why forming a team might be the right move for you. Learn more here.</em></p>

My mentor Gary Keller always said, “If you want to go up, you’ve got to let go.” That sounds backward, but it actually means that you might have to let go of your ego in order to advance in this industry. I was able to absorb a lot of good information from my mentors and coaches, and today I’d like to give something back. Here are six reasons why joining or forming a team might be the right move for you:

**1\. Overhead.** Real estate is an expensive business; if you’re selling at a high level, you likely have several out-of-pocket expenses each month to keep your business running. When you work on a team, you generally have low or even no overhead. If you’re sick and tired of spending all that money to be able to make more money, it might be time to join a team.&nbsp;

**2\. Systems.** Having systems creates a predictable process that homeowners can feel comfortable being a part of and that gives buyers a sense of certainty about your success. A process that can be duplicated by many people helps to make everything more efficient. If you work by yourself, you probably don’t have the systems in place to sell as many homes as you want.

**3\. Mentoring/coaching.** When you work on a team, your team leader may have a coach they share with you. On our team, we get coaching through Tom Ferry and Team Plus, and all of our agents have their own coach to learn how to become even better. On top of the third-party coaching, I offer my own training sessions every week and mentor my team on a daily basis to help them succeed by learning from the mistakes I made.&nbsp;

Working on your own, it’ll be hard to reach the highest possible level of production because you don’t have anyone in your corner to hold you accountable to root you on.

**4\. Collaboration.** Real estate can be a very lonely business. When you’re on a team, you can collaborate not only with the team leader, but also with the administrative staff and fellow agents. Our team has become a little family where we leverage each other’s brains and find ways to improve.

**5\. Culture.** Because our team is a family, we hold each other accountable during tough times, but always lift each other up when times are good.&nbsp;

**6\. You get to have a life.** When you’re a solo agent without any systems in place or anyone to collaborate with, there’s no one to keep your business going when you take a vacation. Having a team means a group of capable people to ensure that business continues as usual as you take time to manage your life outside the workplace. With a team, you can actually have a life of your own.

No matter where you are in your career, you can definitely benefit from working in a team environment. If any of these reasons speak to you and you’d like to schedule a strategy session with me to learn more about what my team has to offer, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. I’d love to learn more about you and discuss what the next step for you could be.
