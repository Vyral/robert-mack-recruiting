What’s the difference between someone who invests in themselves and someone who doesn’t?

To answer this question, let’s move away from real estate for a second. If you look at how a professional athlete spends their year, about 90% of their time is devoted to practicing—i.e., finding ways to be better. They’re in the gym and working on their diet so they can be as strong as possible and have the highest energy levels. They’re running the same plays thousands of times so when it’s game time, they’re ready to go.&nbsp;

If, on the other hand, they just go out and play the game, will they be able to run the plays correctly, or have the endurance to last the entire match? Probably not.&nbsp;

As an agent, you need to use the same philosophy. **If you just come into the office with no practice, structure, or strategy and try to do your job, you won’t find yourself among the top 3% of agents nationwide.** You have to spend 90% of your time practicing, whether that means practicing role-playing scripts, listing presentations, buyer presentations, etc. When you meet with a client face to face, it’s game time. You want to win these “matches,” and if you’re not practicing on the back end, you’re practicing on your clients. If that’s the case, you’re probably not converting at a high level.

So ask yourself, do you have a business coach or team leader who can be your mentor? Are you masterminding with other agents? Are you attending events and learning more about the real estate industry? Are you taking continuing education classes or subscribing to important market newsletters? Do you understand what it takes to be a great agent in today’s industry instead of the one from 10 years ago?

**Being a real estate professional requires an immense amount of knowledge**—not just about what’s happening now, but also about what’s happened in the past and what’s anticipated for the future. You need to use the most up-to-date systems and strategies to help your clients at the deepest level, and surrounding yourself with talented individuals will help you create your vision.
