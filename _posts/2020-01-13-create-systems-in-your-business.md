Today’s message is for the agent who’s winging it.&nbsp;

Let me be clear: There’s nothing wrong with winging it. I winged it for eight years until I figured out it’s much easier to have systems in place than transfer everything that’s in your head and laying it out into the entire process. You might be a great agent with a lot of experience and the heart of a teacher, but if you don’t have systems, your life will be harder. We know that **predictability creates consistency, consistency equals certainty, and certainty equals trust.&nbsp;**

When you meet with a seller and they say “You’re hired\!”, do you have an outlined plan? In other words, a step-by-step strategy covering what you need to get done so that the home is ready for the market? If you open escrow on a buyer, do you have a plan to help them get from point A to point Z smoothly and efficiently?&nbsp;

By “system,” I don’t mean something that has to be high-tech. All you have to do is take the entire process (whether it’s onboarding a listing, opening a buyer or seller escrow, etc.), dissect the plan, and write down everything that has to happen before the next step.&nbsp;

For example, if you have a new listing, you know you have to do things like clean the carpets, make some minor repairs, stage it, and take photos and video, right? All these items are part of your strategy, and on my team, we dissect the process and outline everything that has to happen before the home is ready to hit the market.

There may be 80 things on this checklist, but only 50 might apply to us. If we walk into a home that’s already staged, we don’t have to worry about cleaning the carpet, making repairs, and all that other stuff. All we have to do is focus on photos. Not everything has to be done, but having a comprehensive list of everything that could happen will make your life easier. It will make your process more predictable and more duplicatable.&nbsp;

If you decide to hire an assistant or expand your team in other ways, they’ll be able to help you through the process because everything’s not just confined to your own mind anymore—it’s all on paper, so to speak.

So I encourage you to **take all the different processes that can happen, break them down into a system, and create a more predictable process.** It will make your life easier, you’ll be able to help more people, and you’ll make more money. On my team, we have all the processes outlined so that our agents don’t have to think. They can focus on what’s most important: making phone calls, going on appointments, and writing contracts.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about implementing systems in your business or have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you. Until then, happy selling\!
