<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you planned for 2020? Today I’ll shed some light on planning for the upcoming year now that we’re approaching the end of 2019.</em></p>

Making a business plan doesn’t have to be that complicated. I think a lot of real estate agents, and people in general, tend to overthink things. **Today let me break it down into three parts so you can put together your business plan for 2020.**

Last year, the Robert Mack Group had a team retreat; the theme was crafted around the questions “What, Why, and How?”

**WHAT:** How many families do we want to help? How many homes do we want to sell?

**WHY:** What is the driving force behind all your activities?

**HOW:** What do we have to do on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis to be able to achieve our goals?

Suppose you want to sell 12 homes in 2020. Knowing **what** that number is is a fantastic start, but knowing **how** you can get there is a whole different ball game. You might have to break it down first. If you want to sell 12 homes in a year, that means you’ll have to sell one home per month.&nbsp;

From there, what do you need to do on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis? Who do you need to call? What should you say on those calls? How long should calls last? Do you have to go to networking events and meet with other professionals? Do you have to send out mailers, call expired listings, knock on FSBO’s doors?

There’s no wrong way to generate a lead, but you have to know what to do on a micro-level in order to achieve your macro-level goal.

Don’t forget your ‘**why**,’ either. Having a strong motivating factor that will inspire you to do what you have to do is a powerful aspect of achieving your goals. In real estate, there are no standards or thresholds to get into the business, so motivation will fuel your fire to ensure you succeed.&nbsp;

If you want to have a great home for you and your family, that’s your why. If you want to take your spouse on a trip, that’s your why. If you want to pay off your parents’ house for them, that’s your why. If you want to build an animal sanctuary because you’re passionate about animals, that’s your why. There’s almost certainly something there beyond wanting to make money so you can be financially free—everyone wants that. What are you going to do with the money that you’ll earn from the families you help?

If you know another agent in the marketplace who might benefit from seeing this video, feel free to pass it along to them. If you’re a solo agent or you’ve been in this business for a while and you’re looking for something bigger and better, reach out to me. We can discuss how my team operates and figure out whether or not our process would be good for you. Hope to hear from you soon\!
