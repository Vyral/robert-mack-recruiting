As an agent, your database is vitally important to the continued success of your career.&nbsp;

For a frame of reference: **6****0% of the homes we sell on a yearly basis come from our database.** Our database includes our friends and family, past coworkers, other professionals in the industry, vendors, past clients, other agents in other areas, etc. I’m constantly looking for ways to grow my database by talking to new people every single day.&nbsp;

What can you do to build and grow your database?

There are tons of different databases out there to choose from. Don’t get caught up on which one is the best. Just get one you’ll use, and the simplest one is probably your best option. Just have a place where you can store emails, phone numbers, addresses, names, and other relevant information. Also, make sure it’s a place where you can write notes and task reminders about your clients in a timely manner.&nbsp;

**Your friends and family know you sell real estate, but the fortune in this business is found in the follow-up.** Your clients won’t always be thinking about you, and they won’t always think to call you if they have a need. They’ll call the first person they think of, but if you haven’t positioned yourself as the professional agent in their life, you won’t get that call.

I can’t tell you how many of my close friends never ended up calling me to help them buy or sell a home because they assumed I was too busy for them. That shouldn’t be happening to you.&nbsp;

So find a database you’ll use (you’ll probably have to spend a little bit of money) and add your friends and family, past coworkers, your current and past clients, and anyone else you pay money to. My hairstylist is in my database—so is my mechanic.

**You need to grow your database every single day.** On my team, our goal is to grow our database by five to 10 individuals each day. How do I find these people? There are a variety of ways. They could be random connections at the grocery store. They could be the result of cold calling or expired listings. In any case, you should always be collecting data, and every time someone reaches out to you because they want to buy a home, they go into your database.&nbsp;

How do you stay in touch with your database? We have a 55-point marketing plan, meaning we “touch” our clients at least 55 times per year through email, text, direct mail, newsletters, etc. If you don’t have a lot of money at your disposal, though, I think at a minimum you should do a monthly newsletter. Focus more on who’s getting that newsletter on a monthly basis rather than the content of that newsletter.&nbsp;

If you add people to your database and stay in touch with them, you will make money—I guarantee it.&nbsp;

If you’d like to learn more about building your database or you’re thinking of joining a new team, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. Until them, keep selling houses\!&nbsp;
