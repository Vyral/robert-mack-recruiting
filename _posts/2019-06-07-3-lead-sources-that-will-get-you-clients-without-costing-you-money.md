If you’re a new agent struggling to create a business model that enables you to close transactions on a monthly basis, I know what you’re going through.&nbsp;

13 years ago, I was a new agent who had no idea what I was doing and no money to spend on marketing. I had to find a way to get in front of people and build a rapport with them so that if they had any real estate needs, I would be their go-to resource.&nbsp;

That being said, there are three prime lead sources you can use that require little-to-no budget at all. &nbsp;

The first is your **database**. I wish someone would’ve told me when I first got into the business that I would need to get a CRM and start storing all the people in my sphere of influence. Who are these people? Your friends, family, past clients and current clients, other professionals who share the same clients you do, people you used to work with, and anyone else you do business with. Your database is the people who know, like, and trust you. They know who you are and how you can help them.&nbsp;

The second lead source is **open houses**. As a Realtor, it’s very rare to get walk-in traffic to your office. What’s the best way to get in front of buyers and sellers, then? The open house. It doesn’t have to be your listing. If it is, that’s great, but it can be your team leader’s or any other team member’s listing. If you’re not on a team, you can ask your broker what listings you hold open houses in.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, just make sure you get into these open houses and make sure people come who you can talk to. It’s the best way to get in front of people who don’t have an agent. You can then build a rapport with them and collect their information so that one day, once their ready to buy, you’ll be able to help them.&nbsp;

The last is **a farm**, or a geographic area an agent chooses to build their visibility. When I started my first farm, I would print my own half-page market updates and deliver them door to door in my neighborhood. I did that for two years, and from there I built a business by selling more homes, doing more open houses, and directing mail.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. Until the, happy selling\!
