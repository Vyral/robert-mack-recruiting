Do you want referrals or referral partners? Today **I hope to help you find ways to improve your business, make more money, and help more people.&nbsp;**

Not everyone knows what the difference is between referrals and referral partners. A referral is a one-off; for example, if your neighbor refers you to their friend, it’s a one-time deal. Could you conceivably receive more referrals from that neighbor? Absolutely\! Is that going to be a constant stream of income? Probably not.&nbsp;

We’re grateful for every opportunity we receive, so if someone referred us to another person, thank you so much; it means the world to us that you endorsed us\! However, let’s shift our focus to something a bit bigger. What’s a referral partner? They are professionals who share the same type of client you’re looking for. They may need your services as they help their client.&nbsp;

**One of my favorite referral partners is an estate planning attorney**—they deal with homeowners all the time. Often, when a homeowner passes away and the property passes on to a beneficiary, they may want to sell that home. That person may not have a relationship with a real estate agent, but they do have a trusted relationship with their attorney. If you have an excellent relationship with that estate planning attorney, they can refer you.&nbsp;

So, when I talk about referrals versus referral partners, the goal is to generate referrals that keep on coming. You could spend tons of time touching base with family, friends, neighbors, and so on, or you could spend some time on them, and some on the referral partners and find different people to help. Some examples of good partners are general contractors, CPAs, divorce attorneys, etc. These are the people who work with the type of clients you’re looking for.&nbsp;<br>If you can establish a solid relationship with them, you can generate a lot of referrals. Also, you can refer clients back to them if you know of someone in need of their services.&nbsp;

One year I sold five homes as a result of referrals just from my estate planning attorney referral partner. So, **if you’re looking to help more people and spend less time prospecting leads, consider looking for referral partners.&nbsp;**
