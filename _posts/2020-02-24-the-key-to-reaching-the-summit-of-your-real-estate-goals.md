<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How will a team help you to get to the top? Find out today.</em></p>

In March of 2018, one of my extended team members and business coaches said, “Robert, I have an idea and I want you to come along.”&nbsp;

When I asked him to tell me more, he said, “I want to climb Mount Aconcagua in December, and I want to know if you’re in.”&nbsp;

I told him I’d never heard of Mount Aconcagua. Before that point, I’d always been an avid backpacker and hiker; I loved the outdoors. So after researching it, I learned that he was talking about a 14-day expedition to climb the tallest peak in South America\! I thought to myself that there was no way I could do that—I couldn’t be disconnected from work for two weeks\!

Long story short: **I did it. But how does this relate to real estate and life in general?**

From the photos we took on the climb (see 1:58 in the video above), you can see three of my friends and I hiking from Camp 1 to Camp 2 on the ninth or tenth day of the climb. The conditions were extreme, and the pictures look pretty epic.

But what you don’t see behind the scenes are the 30 people who helped my team get to that point. We had three expert mountain guides from Aventuras Patagonicas helping us get to the top—we didn’t realize how many people were involved with making sure we had an amazing experience, like the medical team, the porters, the mules, the kitchen staff, and so on.

That’s why this story is relevant: **Only a &nbsp;team of professionals can help you get to the top.** Buying a home can be a big, scary decision, and if you don’t have the right team on your side as you climb that particular mountain, you won’t have someone to ensure your experience is excellent and that the decisions you’ve made were good ones. The same is true for selling property, liquidating your assets, and then transitioning to a different home so your family can have a better quality of life.

About 90% of agents in Orange County are solo agents who take of all the sundry parts of the home buying or selling process on their own. Could I have climbed the mountain with just one person? It’s not impossible, sure, but having a team of professionals helping along the way is the best way to get the most people to the top. I don’t personally believe that I could have climbed to the top of my own mountain with just one person; it would have made the situation so much more challenging (and potentially unsuccessful). But my team absolutely helped me get there.

The bottom line is that when you’re buying or selling a home, there are a lot of moving parts to the process. **You’ll want to work with an agent who will hold your hand from the beginning to the end and who also has a team on staff to make your experience efficient, pleasurable, predictable, and successful.**

So if you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the Orange County area and you’d like to learn more about how my team and I can help you get to the top of your own real estate mountain, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love the opportunity to work with you.
