Today’s message is for the agent who’s just “winging it.”

To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with what you’re doing. I did the same thing for the first eight years of my career. Then I figured out that **it’s much easier to have systems in place.** You might be a great agent with a lot of experience who genuinely wants to help their clients, but if you don’t have systems in place, that will make your life harder. Predictability creates consistency, consistency is certainty, and certainty equals trust.&nbsp;

So if you meet with a seller and they hire you, do you have a plan? In other words, a step-by-step strategy that outlines what must be done to prepare their home for the market? If you open escrow with a buyer, do you have a plan to help them get from point A to point Z smoothly?&nbsp;

A system doesn’t have to be high-tech. **All you have to do is take your processes and dissect them.** Write down every everything that has to happen for each step. For example, if you have a new listing that you know needs work done, has to be staged, and needs photos, fliers, videography, etc., you also know that all these steps are part of your strategy.&nbsp;

On my team, we outline every step that has to take place in this situation before that home hits the market. There may be 80 items on this checklist, but only 50 of them could apply to us. If we walk into a home that’s already set up to be staged, we don’t have to worry about cleaning the carpet, making repairs, and so on. All we have to do is focus on photos.&nbsp;

In any case, having a list of everything that might have to be done will make the process more predictable and more duplicatable in case you decide to expand your team.

So again, take your processes and make a system out of them. We use Google docs to do this, but there are other software systems (e.g., Trello) you can use. All of our processes are outlined so the agents on my team don’t have to think. All they have to do is focus on making phone calls, going on appointments, and writing contracts.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that **by doing this, you’ll be able to help more people and make more money.&nbsp;**

As always, if you’d like to talk more about this topic or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me any way you can. Until then, happy selling\!
