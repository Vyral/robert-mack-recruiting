When new agents finally break into the industry, their success is determined by the number of conversations they have with people they can develop relationships with, and who, over time, they can help buy, sell, or invest in real estate.

In order to be a great Realtor, you have to have a lot of conversations with people about the services you offer. **If you have four or five of these conversations a day, in two or three months, those interactions will lead to clients.**

The problem is that when these agents spend so much time making phone calls, sending texts, and attending networking events, they get busy helping clients find and sell properties and stop having these important conversations altogether.

Your business becomes an entrepreneurial roller coaster once you’ve stopped doing what’s necessary to maintain a pipeline full of prospects. It’s at that point that your business starts to fail, causing you to panic and revert back to making phone calls and networking.

So what can you do to avoid this roller coaster business style? **Here are three suggestions:**

**1\. Hire someone to help you with the paperwork.** Whether that entails hiring an administrative assistant, a transaction coordinator, or working with a virtual assistant, you need to find someone to take some of the work off your plate so that you can focus on higher-level activities.

**2\. Consider joining a team.** A lot of successful teams in Orange County already have the administrative help on the back end. As an agent on a team, you can leverage the admin assistant to help you close more transactions and focus on keeping up with your pipeline and prospects.

**3\. Work longer hours.** If you’re not willing to hire help or find a team with, then unfortunately, you’ll just have to work longer hours. However, don’t stop prospecting altogether—if you do, you’ll be stuck in the roller coaster once again.
