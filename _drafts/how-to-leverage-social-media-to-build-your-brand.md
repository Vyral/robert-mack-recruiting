If you’re looking to grow your business as an agent, now is a great opportunity to leverage social media to get your brand out there.&nbsp;

Social media can be overwhelming for a lot of people, but at the end of the day, that’s the world we live in. So many people communicate via social media, **and the one thing we know about sales is that people want to do business with people they know, like, and trust.** That’s why it’s important to build an online brand that allows people to get to know you.&nbsp;

I’m personally not a fan of having a business page and a personal page. I believe that, as a real estate agent, people want to work with me—not my brand. They want to work with someone honest, who knows what they’re doing, who they can have fun with, and who they can have a great experience with. Social media is a casual platform to let people know who I am.&nbsp;

A key mistake a lot of agents make is constantly talking about business. Buyers, sellers, and anyone else following you don’t necessarily care about your newest listing. They want to know more about you. My rule of thumb is to keep about 60% of my social media personal and 30% business-related. I want them to know who I am—a real estate agent working on doing great things for great people.&nbsp;

On top of that, you have to craft your social media according to who you are. Document what you’re passionate about in your personal life because people want to relate to you on a personal level. Similarly, when talking about business, instead of talking about what you just sold, share the stories you’ve witnessed. People love stories, and they want relatable stories.&nbsp;

For example, in July I created an Instagram story for a client of mine. This client was a first-time buyer who didn’t have a lot of money and was generally terrified of the home buying experience. However, she connected with the right lender, got a great grant, and was able to buy her condo with just $8,000 out of pocket. Afterward, 38 people reached out to me saying if they could buy a home for the same price she bought hers, they’d love to know more about how to do so. People felt comfortable with me, they fell in love with my story, and they wanted to learn more.&nbsp;

So moving forward, embrace social media and let people into your life. Show them what you like to do outside of business, but also talk to them about how you help people in your professional life. **Don’t just talk about how many homes you sold last year; talk about the lives you changed.** That’s what will draw them in.&nbsp;
